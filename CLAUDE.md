# NetBox MCP Server

## Core Concept

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that enables LLMs to interact with NetBox infrastructure data. Built with FastMCP and designed for use by NetBox operators.

**This is a fork of [netboxlabs/netbox-mcp-server](https://github.com/netboxlabs/netbox-mcp-server)** that adds opt-in write tools (create/update/delete) gated behind `ENABLE_WRITES=true`. Upstream is read-only by design; this fork extends that scope. Read-only behavior is preserved as the default — writes only register when explicitly enabled.

**Your role**: Help with features that fit this fork's purpose — a read-by-default NetBox MCP server with opt-in writes. Upstream's `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes the upstream project's scope; on this fork, write-tool work and runtime plugin discovery are both in scope. Challenge proposals that don't fit *this* fork (e.g. GraphQL, hand-adding plugin types to `netbox_types.py`, removing the write gate). Ask clarifying questions when needed.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: >=3.11, <3.15
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **MCP Framework**: FastMCP >=3.0.0
- **HTTP Client**: httpx
- **NetBox API**: REST API via token authentication

**Design Pattern**: Clean separation between MCP server logic (`server.py`) and NetBox API client (`netbox_client.py`) to support future plugin-based implementations.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (ONLY use uv, NEVER pip)
uv sync

# Install the pre-commit hooks (per clone; without this, ruff runs only in CI)
uv run pre-commit install

# The CI gate — all three must pass before work is done
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .

# Run the server locally (requires env vars)
NETBOX_URL=https://netbox.example.com/ NETBOX_TOKEN=<token> uv run netbox-mcp-server

# Alternative: module execution
uv run -m netbox_mcp_server

# Add to Claude Code (for development/testing)
claude mcp add --transport stdio netbox \
  --env NETBOX_URL=https://netbox.example.com/ \
  --env NETBOX_TOKEN=<token> \
  -- uv --directory /path/to/netbox-mcp-server run netbox-mcp-server
```

## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity over cleverness**: Write simple, straightforward code that's easy to understand
- **Readability first**: Code is read 10x more than it's written - optimize for the reader
- **Build iteratively**: Start with minimal functionality, verify it works, then add complexity
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns, but only after the third occurrence
- **Early returns**: Use early returns to avoid nested conditions and improve readability
- **Descriptive names**: Use clear variable and function names that explain intent
- **Less code = less debt**: Minimize code footprint; the best code is no code at all
- **Test frequently**: Test with realistic inputs and validate outputs as you build
- **Functional where clear**: Use functional, stateless approaches when they improve clarity
- **Clean core logic**: Keep business logic clean; push implementation details to the edges

## Version Management

This project uses [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/) for automated version management. Versions are automatically determined from commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

**Release triggers:**

- `feat:` commits trigger minor version bumps (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- `fix:` and `perf:` commits trigger patch version bumps (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body trigger major version bumps (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
- `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `refactor:` commits are logged but don't trigger releases

**Workflow — releases are manual in two steps. Merging a feature PR releases nothing.**

1. Dispatch the **Release PR** workflow (`release.yml`, `workflow_dispatch` only):
   `gh workflow run "Release PR"`. It analyses commits since the last tag and
   opens (or updates) a PR bumping the version and appending the CHANGELOG.
2. Merge that release PR. `release-finalize.yml` fires on its close, creates the
   git tag and GitHub Release, then dispatches `docker-publish.yml` with
   `--ref vX.Y.Z` to build and publish the image.

If no release PR is dispatched and merged, `main` accumulates released-worthy
commits while `pyproject.toml` and the newest tag stay behind — the fixes exist
in the repository but in no artifact anyone can install or pull.

## Code Standards

### Python Conventions

- **Type hints required**: All function parameters and return types must be annotated
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Line length**: 88 characters maximum (Ruff/Black standard)
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Functions and variables: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **String formatting**: Use f-strings for string formatting
- **Imports**: Absolute imports preferred, group standard library → third-party → local
- **Error handling**: Never use bare `except` - specify exception types (e.g., `except ValueError:`); raise descriptive exceptions and let FastMCP handle error responses

### Code Style

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear types, descriptive names, proper error handling, comprehensive docstrings
def netbox_get_objects(object_type: str, filters: dict) -> list[dict]:
    """Get objects from NetBox based on their type and filters.

    Args:
        object_type: String representing the NetBox object type (e.g. "devices")
        filters: Dictionary of filters to apply to the API call

    Returns:
        Either a single object dict or a list of object dicts
    """
    if object_type not in NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES:
        valid_types = "\n".join(f"- {t}" for t in sorted(NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES.keys()))
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid object_type. Must be one of:\n{valid_types}")
    return netbox.get(NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES[object_type], params=filters)

# ❌ Avoid: Missing types, generic names, silent failures, no docstrings
def get_stuff(t, f):
    try:
        return netbox.get(types[t], params=f)
    except:
        return None
```

### Architecture Patterns

- **Abstraction layer**: `NetBoxClientBase` defines interface for future ORM implementation
- **Read-only by default, opt-in writes**: GET tools are always registered. `netbox_create_object`/`netbox_update_object`/`netbox_delete_object` only register when `ENABLE_WRITES=true`; the gate lives in `_register_write_tools()` and is called from `main()`. `netbox_delete_object` additionally requires `confirm=True` and supports `dry_run=True`. Mutations are logged at INFO by the tool layer in addition to NetBox's changelog.
- **Environment-based config**: All secrets via environment variables, never hardcoded
- **Explicit object mapping**: `NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES` dictionary maintains allowed types

## Tool Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tools

1. Define tool function with `@mcp.tool` decorator
2. Include comprehensive docstring with args, return types, and examples
3. Validate inputs before calling NetBox client
4. Return structured data (dict or list); let FastMCP handle serialization

### Tool Naming Convention

- Use `netbox_` prefix for all tools (e.g., `netbox_get_objects`)
- Use descriptive action verbs: `get`, `list`, `search`
- Keep names intuitive for LLM consumption

### Supported NetBox Objects

Tools support core NetBox object types across these modules:

- **DCIM**: devices, sites, racks, interfaces, cables, etc.
- **IPAM**: IP addresses, prefixes, VLANs, VRFs, ASNs
- **Circuits**: circuits, providers, circuit terminations
- **Virtualization**: VMs, clusters, VM interfaces
- **Tenancy**: tenants, contacts, contact groups
- **VPN**: tunnels, IPsec policies, IKE policies
- **Wireless**: wireless LANs, wireless links
- **Extras**: config contexts, custom fields, export templates, image attachments, jobs, saved filters, scripts, tags, webhooks

See `NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES` in `netbox_types.py` for the complete list (`server.py` only imports it).

## Environment Variables

Every setting is defined by the `Settings` class in `config.py` — that is the
single source of truth. The user-facing table is the Configuration Reference in
`README.md`, which covers all of them. Do not maintain a third list here; it
drifted to 4 of 14 entries, omitting every security-relevant one.

When adding a setting, update all three in the same commit: `config.py`,
README.md's table, and `.env.example`. `tests/test_settings_documented.py`
enforces this and will fail otherwise.

The two that most affect how you reason about a deployment:

- `ENABLE_WRITES`: registers `netbox_create_object` / `netbox_update_object` /
  `netbox_delete_object` (default `false`)
- `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: bearer token for the HTTP transport. Effectively mandatory
  for HTTP — the transport validates neither `Host` nor `Origin`, so an
  unauthenticated endpoint is reachable via DNS rebinding even bound to
  localhost.

## Security Considerations

- **Minimal-permission tokens**: Use read-only tokens by default. Only grant write permissions when `ENABLE_WRITES=true` is intentionally set, and even then scope the token to the object types you actually need to mutate.
- **No credential storage**: Tokens passed via environment, never stored or logged
- **SSL verification**: Enabled by default in REST client
- **No plugin surface by default**: Plugin object types are not compiled into `NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES`. They are discovered at runtime only when `ENABLE_PLUGIN_DISCOVERY=true` (default `false`), which keeps the default attack surface to core NetBox. Note that enabling discovery *and* `ENABLE_WRITES` makes discovered plugin types writable — `main()` warns about this.
- **Open source**: All code auditable; report security issues per SECURITY.md

## Testing Philosophy

There is an automated suite: pytest + pytest-cov, declared in `pyproject.toml`
under `[dependency-groups] dev`. Run it with `uv run pytest`. CI runs it on
Python 3.11–3.14 along with `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .`; all three
must pass. Never report work as done without running them.

`tests/conftest.py` holds an autouse fixture restoring the module-level state
`main()` mutates (`server.netbox`, `server.write_denied_types`,
`NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES`, and any registered write tools). Any new test that calls
`main()` relies on it — do not remove it, and prefer stubbing side effects over
letting them happen and be unwound.

When adding tests:

- Mock the NetBox client (`netbox_mcp_server.server.netbox`) rather than requiring
  a live instance; the suite runs with no NetBox reachable
- Validate error handling (invalid object types, missing credentials, API errors)
- Test pagination handling for large result sets
- Assert on the drift, not on a snapshot, where possible — see
  `tests/test_settings_documented.py`, which derives its cases from
  `Settings.model_fields` so adding a setting needs no test edit

## Do Not

### Package Management

- ❌ **NEVER use pip** - Only use `uv` for package management
- ❌ **NEVER use `uv pip install`** - This is forbidden; use `uv add` instead
- ❌ **NEVER use `@latest` syntax** - Specify versions explicitly or let uv manage them

### Code Quality

- ❌ Register write tools unconditionally — they must stay gated behind `ENABLE_WRITES` and `_register_write_tools()`. Never add `@mcp.tool` directly to a write function.
- ❌ Remove the `confirm=True` requirement on `netbox_delete_object` or the `dry_run` parameter on create/update/delete without explicit user agreement
- ❌ Hand-add plugin object types to `netbox_types.py` (the compiled registry stays core-only; plugin types arrive via runtime discovery)
- ❌ Hardcode credentials or NetBox URLs
- ❌ Bypass the `NetBoxClientBase` abstraction
- ❌ Remove type hints or comprehensive docstrings
- ❌ Use print statements (use proper logging via `LOG_LEVEL`)

## Open Source Best Practices

- **Professional communication**: Be courteous and constructive
- **Documentation is mandatory**: A user-facing feature doesn't exist unless documented in README.md
- **Licensing**: Apache 2.0; ensure all contributions are compatible
- **Issue-driven development**: Reference issues in commits and PRs

### Communication Style

- **Be direct**: State what things ARE (avoid "This isn't X, it's Y" constructions)
- **Be brief**: Optimize for reader comprehension, not writer expression
- **Be clear**: Avoid defensive writing patterns and ambiguous language

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **Always use feature branches** - NEVER commit directly to `main`
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names with prefixes:
  - `fix/auth-timeout` - Bug fixes
  - `feat/api-pagination` - New features
  - `chore/ruff-fixes` - Maintenance tasks
- **One logical change per branch** - Simplifies review and rollback

### Commit Practices

- **Conventional commit format** (preferred):

  ```bash
  type(scope): short description

  Examples:
  feat(tools): add netbox_search_objects tool
  fix(client): handle pagination correctly
  chore(deps): upgrade fastmcp to 2.13.0
  ```

- **Commit trailers** for attribution:

  ```bash
  # Link to GitHub issue
  git commit --trailer "Github-Issue:#123"

  # Credit bug reporter
  git commit --trailer "Reported-by:Jane Doe"
  ```

- **Make atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
- **Keep granular history** on feature branch; squash only when merging to `main`

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create or reference an issue** before starting work
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feat/issue-123-description`
3. **Commit in small, logical increments** as you work
4. **Push and open draft PR early** for visibility
5. **Convert to ready PR** when functionally complete and tests pass
6. **Wait for reviews** and address feedback
7. **Merge after approval** and CI checks pass

### PR Guidelines

**PR Description Format**:

- 1-2 paragraphs: State the problem/need and your solution
- Include a focused code example if adding new functionality
- Keep it concise for minor fixes (1-2 sentences is fine)

**What to Avoid**:

- Bullet-point summaries of every file changed
- Marketing language or excessive justification
- Repeating what the code diff already shows

**What to Include**:

- Link related issues: `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`
- Why this change matters (not just what changed)

### Critical Rules

- ❌ **NEVER commit directly to `main`** - Always use feature branches
- ✅ **DO keep commits professional and concise** and focused on the change

## Decision Heuristics

### When to Add a New Tool

✅ **Add if**:

- Exposes core NetBox functionality not currently accessible
- Has clear use case for LLM-driven queries
- Read tools register unconditionally; write tools register only via `_register_write_tools()`
- Follows existing tool patterns

❌ **Don't add if**:

- Duplicates existing tool functionality
- Adds a write tool without going through the `ENABLE_WRITES` gate
- Only benefits niche use cases
- Adds complexity without clear value

### When to Modify the Client Abstraction

Only modify `NetBoxClientBase` if:

- Planning to add plugin-based ORM implementation
- All CRUD methods must remain in sync
- Changes must not break REST implementation

### Progressive Complexity

**Level 1 (New Contributors)**: Add tools, fix bugs, improve documentation

**Level 2 (Maintainers)**: Modify client abstraction, add new object type categories

**Level 3 (Core Team)**: Architectural changes, security-sensitive code

## Common Patterns

### Querying NetBox Objects

These examples show how LLMs interact with MCP tools (conceptual format):

```python
# Get all devices in a site
mcp_tool("netbox_get_objects", {
    "object_type": "devices",
    "filters": {"site": "equinix-dc14"}
})

# Get specific device by ID
mcp_tool("netbox_get_object_by_id", {
    "object_type": "devices",
    "object_id": 123
})

# Find recent changes
mcp_tool("netbox_get_changelogs", {
    "filters": {
        "action": "update",
        "time_after": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
})
```

## Troubleshooting

**"NETBOX_URL and NETBOX_TOKEN environment variables must be set"**
→ Set environment variables before running server

**"Invalid object_type"**
→ Check the `NETBOX_OBJECT_TYPES` dictionary in `netbox_types.py` for supported types
→ Plugin object types resolve only when `ENABLE_PLUGIN_DISCOVERY=true`

**"Connection refused" or timeout**
→ Verify NETBOX_URL is accessible and includes protocol (https://)
→ Check firewall rules and network connectivity

**"Authentication failed"**
→ Verify API token is valid and not expired
→ Ensure token has read permissions for requested objects
